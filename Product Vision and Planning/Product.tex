\section{Product vision}
For Social phobia therapist who want to provide patients with a home treatment system, eCoach is a  solid solution for aiding patients with minimal interaction with the therapist. To ease treatment of social phobic patients, virtual exposure is an ideal solution, for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item It improves the comfort of the patients, because there is no need to leave their home regularly.
\item It reduces costs by minimalizing interaction with the therapist
\item It simulates hard to realize situations in in vivo therapy such as presenting for a crowd or waiting at a bus stop.
\end{itemize}
Currently only virtual therapy systems exists that require a therapist to be present and make the avatar interact with the patient by listening to the patient and selecting the appropriate response. These systems are not sophisticated enough to be used at home and in large scale because the presence of a therapist is still required. To counter this problem attempts have been made to develop an virtual coach to guide the patients with their therapy at home.
eCoach will help, stimulate and inform the patient, but also gives feedback and allows the patient to communicate over the results and progress with the therapist. The results of the exposures are automatically shared with the therapist. This will result in improved adherence of the patient because he/she knows that the therapists monitors the progression.
Further the eCoach gives the patient advice to define sub-goals that are easier to realize than the main goal. Before an exposure session, the eCoach avatar will clearly instruct the patient about the session to improve the patients efficacy. After an exposure session, the eCoach will reflect on the session with the patient and will provide the patient with an overview of his anxiety levels during the session. When appropriate, suggestions for improvement will be given.
Because the eCoach system has to be used by a people with different levels of computer skills, so the system will be user friendly and adaptable to the level of experience of the user. The eCoach avatar will help the user to use the system by giving tips and suggestions at the appropriate moments.
