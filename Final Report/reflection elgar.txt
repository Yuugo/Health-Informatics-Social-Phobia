One of the first things I realised about this project is that it's not just about writing quality software, it is about learning to work in a group on some software. There was a lot of focus on the lifetime of a software project. When I look at just the software we had to write, I am not really exited about it. A lot of times when I thought I knew what the purpose of the program was, I was proven to be wrong. This was a little frustrating for me at first, because I had now idea what we were meant to write. I got over it and accepted it for what it was, and that seemed to work. It went better with time and had more and more fun with it. Overall, from this perspective, it was ok.
But when I look at it as a chance to learn to work in a group on a piece of software that someone else requests with vague language, it is a great learning chance. There is a fat chance that this kind of situation will occur when working in the industry. You have to write some software that you don't really find interesting. You have to work in a group of random people and have to make it work. You don't have a detailed description of what the program has to do. So from this perspective I think it is a great asset to have done this project.
