\f0\fs24 \cf0 Uploading files to the database:\
\
This problem was introduced when the team decided that the therapist could record messages for his/her patients, so that the avatar could talk to the patients. It was needed to upload an audio file to the server and that it could be downloaded and played. The team uses an EWI SQL database server, so only text could be uploaded. So the first sub problem was to convert an audio file into plain text. Then it was discovered that the server has a 1mb upload limit, and the team found that the audio file would be too short. So the next sub problem was to split this string into multiple sections of maximum 1mb and upload it separately. All that was needed now was to download the multiple sections, merge them together and convert them back to the audio file that was recorded be the therapist so that the avatar can speak to the patient. The next problem was to let the avatar actually speak.}
