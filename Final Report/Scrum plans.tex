Problems:
The biggest problem we had during this iteration was running the avatar in the GUI. We expected some integration would have been implemented and this could be easily combined with the program. It turned out to create a lot of problems and it was hard to combine the two. 
In the future we will assign more time to tasks we don’t know what to expect. This will give us more time to understand the problem and give us more freedom if we encounter difficulties during the process.
