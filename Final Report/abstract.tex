A list of issues that occurred during the development of the eCoach program has been made. It covers problems we encountered with our own coding and with third party software. This includes the fact that the Avatar needs a separate process on the computer to fit into the GUI of our program and that the reaction time can be randomly slow or fast, highly dependant on the hardware of the computer, but without consistency. Another problem was the IDE Visual Studio Express which offered limited functionality. 
The development process was meant to be test-driven, but most of our code was GUI based, which made it harder to unit test it. Another problem was the lack of a proper database, limiting our file upload size and speed. Finally, using GitHub for as version control system offered its own set of problems as well.

A good project requires a good team. The teamwork of this team focused on getting things done as fast as possible. No long meetings or drawn out discussions were we had to discuss the implementations. Rather the team compromised and divided tasks right away to get to work as fast as possible. The overall experience was considered positive by every team member.
