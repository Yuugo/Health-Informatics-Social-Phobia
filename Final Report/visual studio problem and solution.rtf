\f0\fs24 \cf0 Visual Studio Express:\
\
For the project, we needed to code in the language C#, because one of TA's had created a library for connecting to the avatar that was written in python. Visual Studio Express 2010 was decided to be the IDE in which the team would code, because it is the easiest IDE for developing in C#. When the coding began, all went well for the first couple of weeks. But than the team faced the limitations of the free version of Visual Studio. We couldn't use a database plug-in, there were no to-do lists and we couldn't use plug-ins in general. The team decided to use the ultimate version of Visual Studio, the downside to this solution was that this is not free but it had an evaluation period, luckily the period would end after the context project had ended.}
