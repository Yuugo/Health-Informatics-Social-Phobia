The emergent architectural design is an important document in de design of software. Design elements such as how the system will be divided into subsystems, how these subsystems will be mapped to processes and computers, how these processes communicate with each other and what shared resources they will have and how the data will be stored (database design). These are all of major importance and will definitely changed throughout the design of the system.
