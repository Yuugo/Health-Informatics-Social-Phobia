In order for the program to work as good as possible some processes have to run at the same time to assure faster and better use of the program. 
For better use and in case of a crash the database should be synchronized while the program is running. While the user is using the program and for instance talking to the avatar the system should be able to store info it has gained from the user and could also retrieve information from the database when the program has to display or use information.
Also the program and the vizard should be threading. While the animation is shown the program should still run to interpret the user and should control the avatar.
